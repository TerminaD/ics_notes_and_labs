# One-Dimensional Arrays
- using memory reference to access elements
- not necessarily stored in memory in a consecutive and linear manner
- array and pointer trickeries
- Function Pointers

# Multi-Dimensional (Nested) Arrays
## Memory Storage
- row-major
- linear

## Conceptualization
- array of arrays
- matrix

## Access
```
For a 2-dimentional array T D[R][C], 
&D[i][j] = X_D + L(C · i + j)
```
- note the difference between accessing nested arrays and multi-level arrays (e.g. an array of pointers pointing to arrays)

## Optimizing
### Fixed-Length Arrays
1. using memory reference instead of array access
2. maintaining pointers to operated-on elements
3. pre-calculated steps in loops

### Variable-Length Arrays
- `T A[expr1][expr2] `can be used as variable or argument as long as `expr1` and `expr2` are evaluable at array's definition
- when using variable-length arrays as arguments, variables in `expr1` and `expr2` need to be introduced before the array

- compared with fixed-length arrays, registers are used to store `expr1` and `expr2`, and multiplication is used to calculate memory address instead of memory reference

- compiling with higher levels of optimization might convert variable-length arrays to fixed-length arrays


# Structures
- **Storage**: stored in a chunk in memory
- **Access**: with relative addressing. The specific address offsets are calculated at **compile-time**
- **Aligning**: internal and external aligning
	- Internal: the starting position of struct members have to be multiples of the length of the data type in question
	- External: the starting and ending positions of the struct have to be multiples of the length of the longest data type in the struct
	- `.align k` can force alignment


# Unions
- length being the greatest of its members
- address at the lowest

- **Bypassing C's Type Safety**
	- can be used to implement type conversion where bit sequence is preserved
	- when converting array of type A to variable of type B, beware of little-endian shananigans!


# Floating Point Registers and Assembly
## History

## XMM Registers Structure
- `%xmm0`, `%xmm1`...

## Operations: Scaler and Vector
- has its own family of assembly instructions

## Comparison Ops
- comparison sets `ZF`, `PF` (Parity Flag) and `CF`
- `OF` and `SF` set to 0

## Conventions
- `%xmm0` used as return register
- all are caller-saved
