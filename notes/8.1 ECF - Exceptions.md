# Control Flow
- Examine a temporal sequence of PC values and the instructions they correspond to
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午3.09.56.png|500]]

- Smooth control flow: $I_k$ and $I_{k+1}$ are neighboring in address space
- Non-smooth control flow: normal jumps & **exceptional control flow**

## Exceptional Control Flow
- Used to implement IO, processes and virtual memory
- How applications interact with the OS
- Write fun programs
- Understanding concurrency
- Understanding how application exception-handling works
	- With non-local jumps: jumps that violate the stack's call-return principle
	- Implemented in C with `setjmp` and `longjump`


# Exceptions
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午3.17.02.png|500]]

- Said events can be related or not related to the program at hand
- **Hardware catches the exception, software handles the exception**

## Exception Handling
- Each exception is given a number
	- Some are given by hardware designers, e.g. divided by 0, arith op overflow
	- Others are given by kernel designers, e.g. system call, IO signal
- When the processor detects a exception with code k, it looks up the corresponding exception handler from the **exception table**
	- The exception table is a jump table allocated and initialized by the OS on startup
	- Its starting address is stored in the exception table base register
	- Calculating and jumping to the respective error handler
- The handler does one of the following:
	- Return control to current instruction
	- Return control to the next instruction
	- Terminate the interrupted program

### Exception Handling vs. Procedure Call
- Return address is not pushed onto the stack, but is the current or next instruction address
- Additional processor states are pushed onto the stack for restarting the interrupted program
- If control is passed to the OS kernel, than the data is pushed onto the kernel stack instead of the user stack
- Runs in kernel mode, has access to all system resources

## Classes of Exceptions

- Async: causes **external the CPU**

### Interrupts
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午3.30.02.png|500]]
- Keyboard sends a signal to the CPU's interrupt pin
- Keyboard place the exception ID, which specifies the device causing the interrupt, on the system bus
- The CPU notices the raised voltage on its interrupt pin after finishing an instruction
- Finds the device and invokes the corresponding handler
- Return to next instruction

### Traps
- Provide an interface between the application and OS, can be used for reading files or creating new processes

### Faults
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午3.35.45.png|500]]
- e.g. Page faults, load stuff from hard drive to memory

### Aborts

## Exceptions in Linux/x86_64 Systems
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午3.38.22.png|500]]
Number 0 through 31 are designed by Intel engineers and are the same for all x86_64 machines

### Hardware Exceptions
- Divide error: does not attempt to fix. General reported by the Linux shell as "floating point exception"
- General protection fault: program references undefined virtual memory regions or attempts to write to read-only segments. Does not attempt to fix. Reported as "segmentation fault".
- Machine check: hardware error

### OS Exceptions
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午3.42.45.png|400]]
- The numbers are `syscall` numbers
- Corresponds to the offset for the kernel jump table (not exception table!)

### e.g. Printing to `stdout`

- `%rax`: `syscall` number
