# Memory Layout
![/img//img/截屏2022-10-07 下午12.31.31.png|300]]

## 1. Runtime Stack
- Size limit of 8MB
- Stores **local data**

### Stack Overflow
- Happens when contents of the stack exceed the size limit
- Most commonly occurs when using recursion

## 2. Shared Libraries
- Stores **huge manually allocated data**

## 3. Runtime Heap
- Stores **reasonably sized manually allocated data**

## 4. Data
- Stores **statically allocated data**
- e.g. global variables, `static` variables, string literals

## 5. Text
- Machine code for the program


# Buffer Overflow
When a buffer without bounds checking is written to the point of overflowing, it corrupts data outside of the buffer area.

## Forms of Attack
1. Stack Smashing
	Overwrite return address of previous frame with the attacker's own
2. Code Injection
	- The input string contains byte-represented machine code
	- Stack smashing leads return address to beginning of injected code

## Defences
### 1. Write memory safe code (Programmer)

### 2. Stack Canary (Compiler)

### 3. Randomized Stack Offset (OS)
- A random amount of space is allocated at the base of the stack at the start of the program, about 2^23 for 32-bit Linux, 2^32 for 64-bit Linux
- Makes it hard for the attacker to locate the injected code
- Part of a broader category of technology: Address-Space Layout Randomization
		- Different parts of the memory layout are mapped to different locations in the memory
- Attack strategy: nop sled
	- Use a load of `nop` instructions to make sure the injected code will be eventually called on no matter what
- Not attack-proof!

### 4. Non-executable Code Segments (Hardware?)
- CPU has built in flags that mark parts of memory for read, write, and execute
	- Everything readable used to be executable
	- x86-64 added separate executable flag
- Stack is marked as non-executable, which prevents code-injection attacks

## Attack Strategies, Evolved
### 1. Piecing together existing code
Does not overcome stack canary

### 2. Gadgets
1. What are gadgets?
	- Pieces of machine code obtained by slicing and concatenating machine code, whose meaning are very different from the original
	- Access them with their address
	- End in `0xc3` (`ret`)
2. Using gadgets
	- Placing a chain of gadget addresses in the stack
	- After one executes, the `ret` instruction causes the next one to execute


# Dynamic Stack Frames
## Frame Pointer
- `%rbp`
- Points to the previous stack pointer, which sits between frames
- Provides a way to deallocate the current frame, whose length is not certain

## The `leave` instruction
Deallocates the current frame
Is equal to:
```Asm
movq %rbp, %rsp
popq %rbp
```
