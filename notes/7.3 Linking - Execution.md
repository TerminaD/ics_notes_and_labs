# Executable Object Files
Kinda like ROFs

## Structure
**ELF Header:** Describes general structure, including the entrance to the program
**.init:** Includes a function `_init`, used for initialization
**.text, .rodata, .data:** Similar to ROF counterpart, but already relocated to final runtime memory address, making `.rel` section unnecessary

Code Segment & data segment is loaded to memory, while other sections are not

## Section Header Table

Describes how code segment and data segment is mapped to memory

- **`flags`** indicates that code segment can only be read and executed
- **`off`** indicates the segment's offset in the executable file
- **`vaddr` & `paddr`** indicate the segment's starting position in memory
- **`filesz`** is the size of the file
- **`memsz`** indicate how much space the segment takes up in memory

For the data segment, `memsz` is 8 bytes bigger than `filesz`, this is due to the `.bss` section needs to be initialized to 0 on loading to the memory

- `vaddr mod align == off mod align`
- Makes loading into memory faster


# Loading & Execution
- Copying code and data from disk to memory
- Done by the loader: `execve`

## The Linux Runtime Memory Layout

- There is possible a gap between read-only code segments and read/write segments sue to alignment
- Address space randomization: though relative location remains unchanged

## The Loading & Execution Process
1. Load code segment and data segment from disk to memory according to the segment header table
2. Jump to `_start()` function, which is defined in system file `ctrl.o`.
3. `_start()` calls `_libc_start_main()` in system file `libc.so`, which initializes the execution environment
4. `_libc_start_main()` calls `main()`
5. The return value is handled still by `_libc_start_main()`, and control is handed back to the OS when needed
