# Processes
## Processes as a Form of Abstraction
- Program has exclusive access to the processor (non-stop execution)
- There is only the program's data and text in the memory

## CPU Temporal Exclusivity: Logical Control Flow
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午3.51.52.png|500]]
- The sequence of PC values inside a process
- Process A and B, and A and C, are **concurrent flows 并发流**
	- Compare with **Parallelism 并行**: two processes running concurrently on two cores or computers

## User and Kernel Modes
- Restrict execution of some instructions (e.g. processor halt, initiate IO event) and access to address space (e.g. kernel region)
- Done by the CPU controlling a bit in the control register
	- 0 - user mode
	- 1 - kernel mode
- Interrupts, faults and `syscall` can go from user mode to kernel mode and return to user mode

## Context
- States needed to restart a preempted process

### Process Scheduling & Context Switch
#### Steps
1. Save current process's context
2. Restore the saved context of a previously preempted process
3. Pass control to the restored process

# Manipulating Processes
## Aside: Program vs. Process
- Program: code & data, exists in disk and memory
- Process: an instance of a running program

## Process States: A Programmer's Perspective
- Running
	- Running on CPU
	- Waiting to be scheduled
- Stopped
	- Will not be scheduled for now
	- Triggered `SIGSTOP`, `SIGTSTP`, `SIGTTIN`, `SIGTTOU` until `SIGCONT`
- Terminated
	- Will never run again
	- Reasons
		- Received a signal
		- Returning from main routine
		- Calling the exit function

## Spawning a Process with `fork`
### Properties
- **Call once, return twice:** to the parent process and to the newly created child process

- **Concurrent execution**
- **Duplicate but separate address spaces**
- **Shared files** (`stdout` in this case)

### Multiple `fork`s

## Running a Program with `execve`
- **Call once, never return**
- The user stack is overwritten but context is saved

### Prototype
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午4.40.37.png|500]]
- `filename`: name of executable file or script
- `argv`: list of arguments
	- ![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午4.42.09.png|500]]
- `envp`: list of environment variables
	- ![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午4.42.58.png|500]]

### Function
- Set up user stack
- Pass control to new `main` function
	- `int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]`, where `argc` is the number of non-null pointers in `argv`
	- User stack before executing `main`:

## Terminating a Process with `exit()`
- **Call once, never return**
- Exit with status code

## Reaping Child Process
- A process that has been terminated but not yet reaped by its parent process is called a **zombie process**
- If a parent does not reap its child processes on termination, the `init` process (pid = 1) reaps them

### `wait`
- `int wait(int* child_status)`
- Suspends current process until one of its children terminates
- Return value is its pid


### `waitpid`
#### Prototype
`pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int* statusp, int options)`

**`PID`**
1. `pid > 0`: The process waited for is a single children process with ID of `pid`
2. `pid == -1`: The processes waited for is the collection of all child processes created by the parent process

**`statusp`**
- Non-empty: the `waitpid` function writes status info about the child that caused the return to the pointer

- `WIFEXITED(status)`. Returns true if the child terminated normally, via a call to exit or a return.
- `WEXITSTATUS(status)`. Returns the exit status of a normally terminated child. This status is only defined if `WIFEXITED()` returned true.
- `WIFSIGNALED(status)`. Returns true if the child process terminated be- cause of a signal that was not caught.
- `WTERMSIG(status)`. Returns the number of the signal that caused the child process to terminate. This status is only defined if `WIFSIGNALED()` returned true.
- `WIFSTOPPED(status)`. Returns true if the child that caused the return is currently stopped.
- `WSTOPSIG(status)`. Returns the number of the signal that caused the child to stop. This status is only defined if `WIFSTOPPED()` returned true.
- `WIFCONTINUED(status)`. Returns true if the child process was restarted by receipt of a `SIGCONT `signal.
