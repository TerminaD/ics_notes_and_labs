# Storage Technology
## Random-Access Memory (RAM)
### Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM)

### Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM)
- Structure: 2-dimensional grid of supercells
- Read: read an entire column, then read a supercell from the column

#### DRAM Modules
- 8 Modules, read a supercell from each, make up a 64-byte block

#### Enhanced DRAM

### Comparison

## Non-Volatile Memory (ROM)
1. PROM
2. EPROM
3. EEPROM
4. Flash Memory

## Hard Disk
1. Structure
2. Calculating Latency
3. Logical Abstraction

## SSD
1. Structure: Blocks and pages
2. Workings: Page can only be written after the entire block is erased

## IO Devices


# Locality
1. Temporal locality
2. Spatial locality

Locality in loops: the less looped code, the better
Locality in steps: the smaller the stride, the better
