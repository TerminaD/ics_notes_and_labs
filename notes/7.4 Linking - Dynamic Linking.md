# Disadvantages of Static Libraries
- Need maintenance, updates and relinking
- Almost every C program uses standard IO functions. Every thread has its copy of these functions in memory, leading to a waste of memory


# Shared Libraries
- A special class of ROFs
- `.so` suffix in Linux, `.dll` suffix in Windows
- Can be loaded to any memory address while **loading** or **executing**
- Can be linked to a program in memory: **dynamic linking**

## Construction
```Bash
gcc -shared -fpic -o libvector.so addvec.c mulvec.c
```
- `-fpic`: non-location-specific

```Shell
gcc -o prog2 main.c ./libvector.so
```

# Dynamic Linking
![[/img/截屏2022-11-05 下午1.30.42.png|500]]

## Load-time Linking
- During link-time, no code from the dynamic library is actually copied to the executable file, only relocation information and the symbol table
- On loading, the loader discovers a section named `.interp` in the executable, which includes the path to the dynamic linker `ld-linux.so`
- The loader loads the dynamic linker to memory, and it handles the relocation of data and code
	- Step 1: **Relocating the text and data of `libc.so` into some memory segment**
	- Step 2: **Relocating the text and data of `libvector.so` into another memory segment**
	- Step 3: **Relocating references in `prog2` to these 2 libraries**
- The dynamic linker hands over control to `prog2`. From this point, the location of all shared libraries are fixed
- `prog2` starts execution

## Runtime Linking with Interfaces
![[/img/截屏2022-11-05 下午1.42.00.png|500]]

`RTLD_LAZY` delays the resolution of symbols to when they are called by running code

### Advantages
- Easy distribution: no manual relinking required when libraries are updated
- Building high-performance web servers


# Position-Independent Code
- Code from dynamic libraries have to be able to be **loaded to any location in memory**
- All dynamic libraries have to be position-independent. This can be done by passing the `-fpic` flag to GCC.

## PIC Data Reference: How a Shared Module References External Variables
- The distance between a given instruction and a given variable is a runtime constant no matter where in memory they are loaded
- Global variables can be referenced much as in static linking, but GOT is necessary for external variables.

1. Compiler generates GOT at the beginning of data segment, where each 8-byte entry corresponds to a global data object (function or global variable). These global variables are referenced by utilizing the distance between an instruction and an entry, which is known at compile-time.
2. At load-time, the dynamic loader has decided the runtime address of all global variables, and each entry in GOT is substituted with an absolute address.

## PIC Function Calls: How Functions Defined in Shared Modules are Called
### Lazy Binding
- The binding of each procedure address is deferred until the first time the procedure is called
- Motivation: only a handful among thousands of functions defined a shared library will actually be called. Avoid load-time overhead.

### GOT
- `GOT[0]`, `GOT[1]`, `GOT[2]` are specific addresses, as shown in the figure below
- Other entries relating to functions are initialized to the address of the second instruction of each function's corresponding PLT entry

### PLT
- `PLT[0]` calls the dynamic linker
- `PLT[1]` calles `__libc_start_main`

# Library Interpositioning
## What It Does
- Trace calls to a library function
- Trace its input and output
- Execute your own code in its place

## How
- Create a **wrapper function** for the target function to be interposed on with an identical  prototype with the target function
- Trick the system into calling the wrapper function instead of the target function
- The wrapper function usually runs its own logic, calls the target function, and pass the return value of the target function to the caller

## Compile-Time Interpositioning
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午2.51.09.png|500]]

1. Use `define` directives in local header document to substitute wrapper function for target function
2. Compile and link as such:
```Shell
gcc -DCOMPILETIME -c mymalloc.c
gcc -I. -o intc int.c mymalloc.o
```
The `-I.` flag tells the preprocessor to search for header files in the current directory before searching system directories.

## Link-time Interpositioning
![[/img/截屏2022-11-12 下午2.51.30.png|500]]

```Shell
gcc -DCOMPILETIME -c mymalloc.c
gcc -c int.c
gcc -Wl,--wrap,malloc -Wl,--wrap,free -o intl int.o mymalloc.o
```
The `-Wl` flag passes the following options to the linker, substituting spaces for commas

## Run-Time Interpositioning

- Manipulating the dynamic linker's `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable. `LD_PRELOAD` is a list of shared libraries that will be searched before any other shared libraries.
- Building the shared library that contains the wrapper functions: `gcc -DRUNTIME -shared -fpic -o mymalloc.so mymalloc.c -ldl`
- Compiling the main program: `gcc -o intr int.c`
- Running the program: `LD_PRELOAD="./mymalloc.so" ./intr`
