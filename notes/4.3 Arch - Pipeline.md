# General Principles of Pipelining
## Non-Pipelined Case
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午12.23.01.png | 300]]

**Delay:** The time it takes for an instruction from start to finish
**Throughput:** The number of instructions executed per unit of time
	- Unit: GIPS (Giga-Instructions per Second)
	- In this case, non-pipelined throughput is 3.13GIPS

### Aside on Registers
In reality they are clocked

## Pipelines
### An Ideal Pipeline
Clock speed at 120ps:

- Pipelined throughput is 8.33GIPS
- **Registers act as buffers, preventing instruction clashes**

### A More Realistic Scenario
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午12.36.10.png]]

- Clock speed has to accommodate the highest-latency part of the pipeline, placing it at 170ps; throughput is now at 5.88GIPS
- Register overhead means a deeper pipeline has limited performance improvements
- Data dependency & control dependency

**Mod 1: Circuit Retiming:** creating a set of registers so that PC can be updated at the beginning of a clock cycle instead of the end
	- The logic behavior is preserved

**Mod 2: Inserting Registers**
Naming conventions:
- `S_Field`: value of Field held in S stage register
- `s_Field`: value of Field computed in stage S

# Pipeline Hazards

## Data Hazards

### Solution: Pausing
#### When to pause?
When current instruction is in **decode** phase, **compare the registers accessed with the registers currently in execute, memory or write back phase.** If there does exist one or more register in E, M or W, the instruction is paused until all of the registers are no longer being executed on.

#### How to pause?
Inserting bubbles, empty instructions which has no effect on the programmer-visible state.
	- Bubbles is not an efficient way to prevent data hazards as data dependencies are prevalent in computer programs

#### Bubble Implementation
Introduce 2 control signals: stall and bubble
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午1.36.11.png|300]]

- Normal pipeline: stall = 0, bubble = 0
- Pause: stall = 1, bubble = 0
	- Register always retain previous state
	- "Jamming" an instruction at a certain stage
- Insert bubble: stall = 0, bubble = 1
	- Register always output `nop`

e.g. Inserting bubble at E register

- `icode` set to `INOP`
- `dstE`, `dstM`, `srcA`, `srcB` set to `RNONE`

**Mod 3: Forwarding**
- Allowing data to be directly sent to decode stage from E, M, or W stage
- Eliminating the need for bubble for **read-after-write dependencies**

### Load/Use Data Hazards
- Using data read from memory
- Simple forwarding is not enough as data cannot be sent back in time
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午1.16.05.png]]

- Using both pausing and forwarding
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午1.16.51.png]]

## Control Hazards
### `ret` instructions
- Instruction following `ret` have to wait for the last instruction's memory stage to finish
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午1.27.33.png]]

### Conditional Jumps
- Have to wait for conditional jump's execute stage to finish
- **Branch Prediction**

- e.g. Prediction strategy: always taken

# Pipelined Y86 Implementation
## Fetch Stage: Predicting The Next PC
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午2.02.50.png]]
1. Sequential Execution
	- `valP = PC + ins_len`
2. Jump Execution
	- Presume the branch prediction strategy to be always taken
	- Thus, `valP = valC`
3. `ret`
	- Does not predict, treating it as sequential


### The Select PC logic unit 
Fixes misses in PC prediction
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午2.16.02.png]]
1. `ret`
	- reads `icode` to make sure it's a `ret` instruction
	- reads `W_valM`, which is what last instruction has read from memory
2. Conditional Jump
	- After decode and execution
	- Takes in `M_icode` and `M_Cnd`
	- How to fix: read next instruction's address from `M_valA` (Combined with `valP`?)

## Decode Stage
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午2.36.30.png]]
**How to determine whether to use data accessed from the register or forwarded data?**
	- If the register ID is equal to forward destination's register ID, use the forwarded data

**What data to forward?**
- ALU's output
- Memory's output
- Data to be written to registers after memory stage
- Data to be written to register's interface M after write back stage
- Data to be written to register's interface E after write back stage

- Each forwarding source includes the register ID and data
- Forwarding source priority is as listed

**Sel+Fwd A**
- Has the additional functionality of selecting `valA` and `valP`
- Why is this combination feasible? Only `call` and `jxx` uses `valP`, both of which instructions does not need to read from `rA`. Whether the current instruction belongs to the two categories can be checked with `icode`

## Other stages are pretty similar from sequential.


# Pipeline Control Logic
Pipeline's control logic has to detect hazards and deal with them.

## Control Conditions
### Load/Use Data Hazards
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午2.40.32.png]]
- This can also happen with `popq` instructions

### Mispredicted Branches
Insert 2 bubbles to clear out misfired instructions

### `ret`
Insert a bubble at decode for three times
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午2.44.15.png]]

### Exception Handling

## Combination of Control Conditions
### `jxx` + `ret`
![/img/截屏2022-10-17 下午2.48.01.png]]

### Load/Use Hazard + `ret`
`%rsp` clash

Standard procedure puts D on both stall and bubble, while in reality stall is enough


# Performance Analysis
CPI - Cycles Per Instruction

## Definition and Breakdown
When in a given timeframe,
$C_i$ instructions were executed and $C_b$ bubbles were executed during $C_i + C_b$ cycles,
then 
$$CPI = \frac{C_i + C_b}{C_i} = 1.0 + \frac{C_b}{C_i}$$
$$CPI = 1.0+lp+mp+rp$$
where 
$lp$ is load penalty, the average number of bubbles per load/use hazard,
$mp$ is mispredicted branch penalty, the average number of bubbles per mispredicted branch,
$rp$ is return penalty, the average number of bubbles per `ret` instruction.
