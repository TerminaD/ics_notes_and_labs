# Stages of CPU Operation
1. **Fetch** 取指
2. **Decode** 译码
3. **Execute** 执行
4. **Memory** 访存
5. **Write Back** 写回
6. **Update** 更新PC

- Not all instructions go though all 6 stages!
- To prevent data clash, the processor never reads data for an instruction that is updated by it

# Fetch
Reads 10 bytes and determine the length of the instruction

- `rA` and `rB` are 0xF if empty
- produces `icode`, `ifun`, `rA`, `rB`, `valC` and `valP` (PC + instruction length)

# Decode
Reads data from the register file (up to 2 at the same time)

- `icode` is needed to generate register id as some instructions (`push`, `pop`, `call`, `ret`) need to access `%rsp` even if not explicitly stated 

# Execute
Data is fed into the ALU, producing a result and condition codes

- ALU can do 3 types of ops:
1. Arithmetic
2. Effective address
3. push & pop

- When performing an op that doesn't require operating on 2 numbers, the ALU performs an +0 operation
- The `Set CC` module makes sure that condition codes are only set when ALU is performing arithmetic instructions
- The `Cond` module generates a boolean value indicating whether to execute a **conditional jump**
- produces `cnd` and `valE`

# Memory
Read and write from memory

![/img/截屏2022-10-15 上午11.03.17.png]]

# Write Back
Write to the register file

- `cnd` is fed to register id decoder to make possible **conditional move**: if `cnd == 0`, the destination address is set to 0xF

# Update
Set program counter to the address of the next instruction

Cases:
1. `call`
	`PC = valC`
2. `ret`
	`PC = valE`, which is the address stored in `%rsp`
3. `jxx`
	if `cnd == 1`, `PC = valC`
4. default
	`PC = valP`
