# Intro to Linking
- Splitting large-scale programs into multiple smaller ones
- After one program file is modified, only that one needs to be re-compiled

- **Linking**: combining relocatable object files and system files to create an executable file

## The Why
- Understanding linking-related problems when building large-scale programs
- Avoid dangerous programming errors
- Understanding how **scoping** works
- Understanding system concepts
- Make better use of shared libraries


# The Compilation System
![[/img/截屏2022-11-02 下午1.23.36.png | 300]]

## Pre-Processor
- `cpp -o main.i main.c` , where `cpp` stands for c preprocessor
- or `gcc -E -o main.i main.c`

- Expands derivatives: expands the file path for includes files, macros, control conditional compilation, etc.


## Compiler
`cc -S -o main.s main.i`
`cc`: c compiler

or `gcc -S -o main.s main.i`

## Assembler
`as -o main.o main.s`
`as`: assembler
`main.s`: relocatable object file

## Linker

## Running
`./prog`
This done with the **loader** in shell, which copies `prog`'s instructions and data to memory, and hands over control to the start of `prog`

### ELF Header
`readelf -h main.o`

#### Magic
![[/img/截屏2022-11-02 下午1.37.27.png | 500]]

**ELF Magic**: Used by the OS to check whether file type is correct

#### Type
- Relocatable file
- Executable file
- Shared fie

#### Size Calculation

### Section Header Table

#### `.text`
Instructions
Can be disassembled with `objdump`

#### `.data`
Initialized global and static variables

#### `.bss`
Uninitialized and **initialized-to-0** global and static variables

- `.bss` has the same offset as `.rodata`
- `.bss` is only 4 bytes long

`.bss` does not actually take up space, instead only marking initialized and uninitialized variables, so that the program can put them on the runtime stack when running 

#### `.rodata`
Read-only data

#### Other Sections

# The Symbol Table
![[/img/截屏2022-11-02 下午1.51.35.png]]

## Fields
- Binding (`Bind`): visible scope
- `Ndx`: index to location, see section header table

## Some Symbols
- **Functions**
	- Value: offset to `.text` section
	- Size: number of bytes
	- If function is not defined in this file, its type is `NOTYPE` and `Ndx` is `UND` (undefined)
- **Global Variables**
	- Type: object
	- Different `Ndx` values: different sections, because one is initialized and one is not
	- `COMMON`: very similar to `.bss`, only that `COMMON` only stores uninitialized global variables
- **Static Local Variables**
	- `Bind`: local
	- Variable name has changed: **name decoration** to prevent clashes
- **Implicit Symbols**
	- Signify sections

Note that local variables are managed by the runtime stack and does not appear on the symbol table

- `extern int x` - `UNDEF` 确定只是声明
- `int x` - `COMMON` 不确定是声明还是定义，因而编译器将决定权交给链接器
- `int x = 0` - `.bss`
- `int x = 1` - `.data`

## Types of Symbols
- **Global Symbols**
	- Defined in this file, can be used by external files
- **External Symbols**
	- Defined by external files
- **Local Symbols**
	- Defined in this file and can only be used by it
	- `static` variables and functions are private to this file only


# Symbol Resolution
Undefined symbols does not raise errors in the compiler and assembler, who assume it is defined in other modules
But what happens with duplicate symbols?

## Resolving Duplicate Symbols
### Strong and Weak Symbols
- Strong Symbols: functions and initialized global variables
- Weak Symbols: uninitialized global variables

- The compiler figures out whether each symbol is weak or strong
- This information is passed on to the assembler, who stores this information in the symbol table

### Resolving Duplicate Symbols
1. Multiple strong symbols: linker raises error
2. One strong symbol and multiple weak symbols: the weak ones are overwritten by the strong one, no warnings or errors raised
3. Multiple weak symbols: same

Potential problems:
1. Overwritten variables
2. Different-length variables might cause "overflow"

The `-fno-common` flag raise errors for duplicate names
